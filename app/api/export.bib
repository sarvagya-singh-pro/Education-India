   abstract = {This paper presents a fault detection and classification scheme for a shunt [static var compensator (SVC)] compensated line. The proposed relaying scheme is based on the concept of superimposed sequence components-based integrated impedance (SSCII). For an internal fault, the magnitude of SSCII is small and for an external fault, it is very large. In the SVC compensated line, a fault forces SVC to vary its impedance. Superimposed components are injected due to this impedance variation, along with the fault components. These SVC-injected components are treated as fault-injected components and, therefore, even the sound phases are detected as faulty phases. To avoid such failure, faultinjected superimposed components have been extracted by using the modified prefault data, which is estimated according to SVC impedance variations. The superimposed components measured using the modified prefault data consist of fault-injected superimposed components only. The proposed scheme has been tested for all types of faults, different values of fault resistances, and several fault locations and SVC locations. The results demonstrate that the proposed scheme successfully detects and classifies the faults. Also, the proposed scheme is robust against variations in fault resistance, source impedance, and SVC location.},

   abstract = {The Proportional Integral Derivative (PID) controllers have been widely used and the trend is continued. There are many new methods and approaches for tuning which can provide improved performance. In this paper we present the development of a PID toolbox with a choice of fourteen methods for P, PI and PID controller tuning, few state of the art PID controllers tuning methods and a case study of dc motor speed control (set point tracking & disturbance rejection).The results of extensive simulations covering classical methods including Ziegler-Nichols (ZN) tuning, ZN step response tuning, Cohen-Coon tuning, the Wang-Juang-Chan (WJC) tuning, Chien-Hrones-Reswick (CHR) PID tuning have led to determine the optimum choice for tuning. Finally a toolbox structure has been developed to provide a user friendly package capable of providing PID controller for models of various configurations including those with dead time and guidelines, to suit the specified process performance.},
